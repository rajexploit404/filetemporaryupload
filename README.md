## Steps

1. Ensure you have `curl` installed on your system and access to the terminal.

*Explanation of the command:

->    --data-binary "@/path/to/file": Where you saved the file in the path.<br>
->   -H "filename: desired_name": Specifies the name of the file when uploaded to Filebin.<br>
->    https://filebin.net/: The URL endpoint where the file will be uploaded.<br>

Once the command is executed, you will receive a response containing the URL to access your uploaded file. For example:

https://filebin.net/diwusoxjie5i6u2t

Copy this URL to share or access the file.
